(collectively termed as the “Services”).\n\nThese Terms of Service (referred to as \"Terms\" or this \"Agreement\") (i) establish the terms and conditions regulating your access to and utilization of the Services, and (ii) constitute a legally binding agreement between us and the individual or entity you represent (\"you,\" \"your,\" or “user”). By using any of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Agreement and agree to be bound by all of its terms.\n\n\nAgreement to Terms; Privacy Policy\n\nKindly peruse these Terms carefully before engaging with the Services. By utilizing or accessing the Services in any manner, or by selecting the option to accept or agree to these Terms through the act of clicking a button or checkbox where such option is provided, you, (i) acknowledge and affirm your acceptance of these Terms, and (ii) grant consent to the collection, utilization, disclosure, and other handling of information as delineated in our Privacy Policy, accessible at site link (insert) (referred to as the \"Privacy Policy\"). The Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety, and all references herein to the \"Terms of Use\", the \"Terms\" or this \"Agreement\", include a reference to the Privacy Policy.\n\nChanges to Terms or Services\n\nWe retain the unilateral right to amend the Terms at our discretion. In the event of such modifications, we will notify you through notice delivered via the {{appName}} App and {{appName}} for Stores App, or by employing other communication methods that we consider reasonable. It is imperative that you peruse the Terms upon each modification, as your continued use of the Services subsequent to any such alteration signifies your legal consent and commitment to comply with the revised Terms.\n\nIf you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services.

Through the act of using the Services and consenting to these Terms, you affirmatively declare and guarantee that:\n\nYou are of lawful age, and are lawfully able, to enter into contracts.\n\nNeither you nor any person that owns or controls you is subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government authority.\n\nRegistration and Your Information; Security\n\nIn order to access specific Services, you may be required to possess or establish an account (the \"Account\").

The exclusive responsibility for the safekeeping and security of your Private Key rests solely with you.
